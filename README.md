# NodeJS_WeatherApp
This is a weather app built in Node.js which makes use of asynchronous HTTP requests. The application communicates with third party APIs ->Google's geo-location API and dark sky API.

Asynchronous, non-blocking application => app will continue to run while it waits for someting else to happen

Google geo location API takes address and returns lattitude and longitude co-ordinates whereas Dark Sky API takes lattitude and longitude co-ordinates as input and generates weather information.
